    <p>Drones are a hot topic, and there are a lot of things to know about them. Below are all the regulations a first-time drone owner needs to know. We address all of concerns from both owners and non-owners. </p>
    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fly below 400 feet and remain clear of surrounding obstacles
        </li>
        <li>Keep the aircraft within visual line of sight at all times
        </li>
        <li>Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations
        </li>
        <li>Do not fly within 5 miles of an airport unless you contact the airport and control tower before flying
        </li>
        <li>Do not fly near people or stadiums
        </li>
        <li>Do not fly an aircraft that weighs more than 55 pounds
        </li>
        <li>Do not be careless or reckless with your unmanned aircraft; you could be fined for endangering people or other aircraft
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All drone owners must register their drone with the government. The registration process costs $5 USD, and all drones over 0.5 pounds must be registered. To register you must be at least 13 years of age, and a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident. Online registration can be used for any drone meeting guidelines. You will receive a unique identifican number that you can use to register all the drones that you own. Each aircraft must be physically marked with the number. This registration will be valid for three years. You must register by paper if the drone will be used for commercial purposes, weighs over 55 pounds, or if you intend to operate outside of the United States.</p>

    <h2>Concerns</h2>
    <p>Drones are an up and coming way of video surveillance. These drones can be equipped with a whole arsenal of high-tech tools including high-powered cameras, microphones, and infrared devices. All of this can cause a problem for the privacy of many. Such drones can and have been used as unwanted surveillance that may cause damages. People are worried about some immature child peeking through their window or crashing a drone into their private property. Such problems have caused some of the current regulation laws to be in effect. An example of one of these problems is that drones have flown too close to an airport, causing delays. As a result of these sometimes serious problems, the <a href="https://registermyuas.faa.gov/" target="_blank">FAA</a> has created regulations to make drones safer and to protect the privacy of people. Multiple drone pilots that use drones for business purposes are worried about such problems happening enough that the government would have to to step in and make even stricter regulations on drones.</p>
