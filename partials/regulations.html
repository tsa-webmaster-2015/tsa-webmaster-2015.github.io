    <p>Drones are a hot topic and there are a lot of things to know about them from concerns to regulations. Below are all the regulations a first-time drone owner needs to know. We address all of concerns from both owners and non-owners. </p>
    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fly below 400 feet and remain clear of surrounding obstacles
        </li>
        <li>Keep the aircraft within visual line of sight at all times
        </li>
        <li>Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations
        </li>
        <li>Don't fly within 5 miles of an airport unless you contact the airport and control tower before flying
        </li>
        <li>Don't fly near people or stadiums
        </li>
        <li>Don't fly an aircraft that weighs more than 55 pounds
        </li>
        <li>Don't be careless or reckless with your unmanned aircraft; you could be fined for endangering people or other aircraft
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All drone owners must register their drone with the government. The registration process costs $5, and all drones over 0.5 pounds must be registered. To register you must be at least 13 years of age as well as be a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident. Online registration can be used for any drone meeting guidelines. You will receive a unique identifican number that can be used for all the drones an individual owns. Each aircraft must be physically marked with the number. This registration will be valid for three years. Owners must register by paper if the drone will be used for commercial purposes, weighs over 55 pounds, or you intend to operate outside of the United States.</p>

    <h2>Concerns</h2>
    <p>Drones are an up and coming way of video surveillance. These drones can be equipped with a whole arsenal of high-tech tools including high-powered cameras, microphones, and infrared devices. All of this can cause a problem for the privacy of many. Such drones can and have been used as such kind of unwanted surveillance that may cause damages. People are worried about some immature child peeking through their window or crashing into their private property. Such problems have caused some of the current regulation laws to be in effect. An example of one of these problems is that drones have flown too close to an airport making the airport have delays so that they could investigate the suspected security problem. As a result of these sometimes serious problems the FAA has to create regulations to make drones safer. Multiple drone pilots that use drones for business purposes are worried about such problems happening enough that the government has to step in and make even stricter regulations on drones.</p>
