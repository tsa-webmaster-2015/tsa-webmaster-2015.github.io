    <p>Unmanned aerial systems (UAS), or drones, are filled from the bottom up with technology. Drones are essentially autonomous flying robots that can be remotely controlled, or even act on their own. They have countless uses, from commercial to educational and everything in between. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Current Technology</h2>
    <p>The current drones have tons of technology. They usually have a battery, motors, propellers, and a central housing unit, along with a few other components specific to the model. The central housing unit holds all of the small components including GPS, circuit boards, and batteries. Drones can be built with the propellers directed vertically or horizontally depending on the use. Drones built to hover or stay in a specific place have propellers parallel to the ground, and drones built to survey large areas tend to have propellers perpendicular to the ground. Drones also have software which allows for things such as programming flight routes, video feed, and GPS systems. Drones sometimes have skids or landing gear that allows the drone to land without harming the technology and mechanics in the drone and on top of the housing structure. Drones continue to have advancements in technology and mechanical elements.</p>

    <h2>Future Technology</h2>
    <p>As with any technology, it gets better and more efficient with time. With drones, the advances in technology are limitless. Drones are getting more efficient in every way. The motors are becoming more efficient and allowing the aircraft to stay in flight for longer periods of time. They are also becoming lighter, allowing for longer flight times, more maneuverability, and larger payloads. As the motors get stronger, the aircraft is able to carry heavier weights including larger batteries and payloads such as cameras.</p>
