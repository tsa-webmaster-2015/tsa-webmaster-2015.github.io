            <br>At Mountain Vista, we take technology very seriously. Our TSA chapter has more than a hundred members, far more than nearly any other school in Colorado. Last year at the state competition, Mountain Vista competitors garnished awards in thirteen events, from Software Development to Underwater ROV, and we are perennial competitors at the national TSA competitions. Mountain Vista is a very technically-oriented school overall, with twenty-seven business and tech classes offered throughout high school to give a truly immersive high school experience in technology and engineering. TSA is one of the biggest extracurricular organizations at Mountain Vista, a tribute to how popular technology has become here, and we hope to see even more members as the year progresses.
